# Scalable Silex Boilerplate App

Silex is a mini version of the Symfony framework.  Out of the box, it's very powerful, but it doesn't leave you with much in the way of setting up a scalable architecture.

This is a boilerplate Silex app that sets up a reasonable way of using controllers, services, routes, models, and a proper config - the way you would expect it to work in a framework like Symfony.

To use:
- install apache, php, composer
- clone the repository
- set a symlink from the repository to the public apache folder
```bash
sudo ln -s ~/path/to/Scalable-Silex-Boilerplate /var/www/
```
